# CAIxDiscord
# Discord Character AI Bot

This is a Discord bot that interacts with Character AI and uses TTS (Text-to-Speech) functionality to generate speech for messages. The bot uses the `PyCharacterAI` library to interact with the Character.AI API.

## Features

- Chat with a character on Character.AI.
- Generate TTS audio from Character.AI responses.
- Interact with the bot via Discord commands.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or above
- Install the required dependencies:

## Installation

Navigate to the directory location where you want to keep caixdiscord either through cmd.exe (Windows) or in your linux terminal.
Next, enter in these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hx4u/caixdiscord.git
```
```bash
cd caixdiscord
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You'll then need to EDIT your config.json file (any text editor will work) and fill in the correct information.
